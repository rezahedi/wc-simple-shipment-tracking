# WordPress plugin: Simple Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce

This plugin adds new order status "Shipped", add new metaboxs to the order edit page where you can add multi tracking information, and add a new email template for the "Shipped" order status under WooCommerce > Settings > Emails.

Shipment tracking Info will appear in customers' accounts (in the frontend orders panel) and in the WooCommerce order shipped email.

## Template Customization

All frontend-related changes can be done by copying the template files to your theme folder and editing the template files in your theme folder.

## TODOs (in the future)

1. Add a plugin settings page to allow users to manage the couriers list, (Add, Edit, Delete, Enable/Disable)
2. Use the couriers icons in the frontend or backend.
